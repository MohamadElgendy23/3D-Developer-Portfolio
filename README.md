# 3D Developer Portfolio (Still being worked on)

Stunning 3D Developer portfolio that is created in popular JS frameworks such as React, Node.js, and Three.js. Also uses Tailwind CSS, a popular ulility-first CSS styling framework.

This portfolio is a full on "about me" that explains why I am a competent developer and a big asset to any team I join. It contains links to the personal projects I created, work experience, and skill sets. Best of all, it accounts for mobile devices as well! This is done by implementing different features for smaller screen sizes. For example, the toggle button on the top right (on small screen sizes) opens up a new navigation bar on click. Feel free to check it out! :)
